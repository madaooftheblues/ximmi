# RabbitMQ on Render

This is a template repo for running a RabbitMQ instance as a **web service** on Render.

It uses the [official Dockerfile](https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq) and backs RabbitMQ with a [Render disk](https://render.com/docs/disks), making it resilient to data loss in the case of restarts or deploys.

### Deployment

See https://render.com/docs/deploy-rabbitmq.
